Thinkin you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck, I got a one track mind Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my ass But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin Only women that I love are my daughters And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it further So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time And it ain't never gonna stop. A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime, so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster I'm goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not been? rude off? so fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too.

Yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds That of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal, I'm not a fair man Disgraced the race of an atheist Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation collaborating attempting to take over the Earth 'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law cause I don't agree with police either Shit, me neither We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain He's insane No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off Cause I can't find a decent vein The disaster with dreads I'm bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 'Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt Hello? Ayo, what's up? We're coming to get you! Stop! They know it's us! I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three 'shrooms And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to Hell and I'm getting ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel We'll be waiting See you in Hell Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady See you in hell for the sequel Bad Meets Evil, what Till next time And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens It's too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on till this day Shhh...

Wounds heal But scars still remaining the same But tomorrow today's gone down in flames Throw the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet As you barely even perspire from the heat Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief And as you say goodbye to the grief It's like watching the walls melt In your prison cell But you've extinguished this living hell Still a little piece of you dies, you scream I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising A phoenix from the flames Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight Now it feels with these wings that I will fly I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light:;Eminem - Beautiful Pain

You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em You look like I sound like, singing about weenies Now take my weenie out of your mouth This is between me and you; I know you're not happy I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges Why're you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous My point is this: That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink Now I forgot what the is, you're just a... You're just jealous of me 'Cause you, you just can't do what I do So instead of just admitting it You walk around and say All kinds of really mean things About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie But it's only 'cause you're Just really jealous of me 'Cause I'm what you want to be So you just look like an idiot When you say these mean things 'Cause it's too easy to see You're really just a big weenie, big weenie Get the fuck off my dick";Eminem - Big Weenie

Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin, It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin. Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end? Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win. Severin legs, arms, damn there goes another limb. Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident. Once again they call me Buffalo Bill, Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill. Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts, Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts. Man, you don't want to go up in those hills, Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills. You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill, Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill. Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin, so chill. Fuckin hoe, ya better fuckin hold still. Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill. Cut em, gut em 'n just get to stuffin those girls. Man, I think she had enough of those pills, So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel Blades, Baby when I cut ya don't squeal, I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you! I keep hearin voices, like ""Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife, And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?"" ""In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin into a Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are."" I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya. Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin with? Duck, because here he comes again. Once again they call me Buffalo Bill, Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill. Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts, Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts. Man, you don't want to go up in those hills, Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills. You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill, Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.";Eminem - Buffalo Bill

So this is it... This is what I wished for Just isn't how I envisioned it Fame to the point of imprisonment I just thought the shit'd be different But something changed The minute that I got a whiff of it I started to inhale it Smell it Started sniffin' it And it became my cocaine I just couldn't quit I just wanted a little bit Then it turned me (in)to a monster I became a hypocrite Concert after concert I was raking in the dough Rolling in green Had the game hemmed up Like a sewing machine But I was losing my freedom There was no where for me To not go and be seen And just go and be me And there was no in-between You either loved it or hate it Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest The Marshall Mathers was a classic The Eminem Show was fantastic But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic And eight years later, I'm still at it Divorce, re-married A felon A father Sleeping pill addict And this is real talk I feel like the Incredible Hulk My back has been broke, and I can still walk So be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold I said Be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold I got a letter from a fan, that said He's been praying for me Every day and for some reason It's been weighing on my mind heavy 'Cause I don't read every Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you? You didn't pray for me when I was local And as I lay these vocals I think of all the shit I had to go through Just to get to where I'm at I've already told you at least A thousand times in these rhymes I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got God on my side And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it? Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint Man, boy's got to look Nuts And that's the only word I can think of right now On how To describe the shit This is like a vibe you get Go ahead and bob to it Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit So be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold I said Be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold";Eminem - Careful What You Wish For

Or am I just a little snappy And they genuinely care Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there And I continuosly stare at pictures of you I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me What the fuck good does that do me now? But somehow I know you're near me in presence Oh I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little And dawg you'll never believe this But Sharonda actually talks to me now Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces Man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different If it's true, how the fuck am I supposed to get over you Difficult as it sounds... Doody, that's what we call each other I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us We was always brothers Never thought about each others' skin colors Til' one day we was walking up the block in the summer It was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn Tryna walk under the trees Just to give me some comfort I'm moaning I just wanna get home When I look over and your shirt is off I'm like you gonna fry and like ""No I won't, I'm black stupid And black people they got melatonin In their skin, we don't burn"" Meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt Like I'm on fire And the entire time you're just laughing at me And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard And I still have to get you back for that shit And by the way them playboy rings My mother stole from you Well Nate finally got 'em back Shit it must have been at least 16 years ago Well I put 'em in your cask - ahhh Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget The motor city motown Hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads It don't stop there Yeah, as difficult as it sounds... And this may sound a little strange but I'ma tell it I found that jacket that you left at my wedding And I picked it up to smell it I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass And hang it up in the hallway so I can always look at it And as for all of me and D12 we feel like fuck rap It feels like our General just fucking died in our lap We shut off all our pages All our cell numbers has changed Our two-ways are in the trash So some cats will have to find a new way And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today But the truth is there all still here and you ain't Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressing on Don't ever give up the dream dawg I got love for you all And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you You were the peacemaker Doody I know sometimes you were moody But you hated confrontation And truly hated the feuding But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping If it had to happen, it had to happen Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to Throw them balls back on Dresden From making cars to paintballing Getting arrested To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting They tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up Didn't show up for court So we got off on a technicality, left sweating Me, you and what's his face I forgot his fucking name Shame he even came to your funeral He betrayed our team And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fucking face And that's on Hailie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54 Just before we were supposed to get in cars To come and see you once more Difficult as it sounds...";Eminem - Difficult

Then wonder why I stay famous I keep walkin' the line This goldfish bowl gets old But especially when you don't know If your conscience is sayin' I told you so Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier Or you sold your soul I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying And from here you look so small Hovering high above us all Please come back To me I still remember the times when They were simpler than the rhymes of Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics I'll never forget what that feeling was like I miss those times now when I was just starting out Without a dime and, now I'm diamond I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been Stuck in this house hibernatin' Hate even going outside It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin' I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time Cause it's been on my mind lately how Zee, you always supported me You vouched, I will never forget that and How you guys accepted me for me and Pace I love you too, you slept on my couch And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at The Outhouse Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do And regardless how life has turned out Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider My life has been turned inside out but I I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying But I keep walkin' the line...;Eminem - Fine Line

I'm a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes! This is the part I was worried about everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes and I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes and everyone's telling me what I should do and how I should come out and what to rap about and I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out and I'm not sure how this is gonna come off they're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (haha) like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me see, the thing about me is you don't really know a thing about me everyone's making a stink about me like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers and the most dangerous criminals and I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors but, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave but why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees? so when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-z please, be that just subliminally means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's the only one up in that league, see and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowing god damn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period. I'm a goat and I don't mean to gloat but I know what I know and I know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat? and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes! Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen man, I thought I was crazy or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way see, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight and Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write because he's so caught up in that snow white that Timbaland can't even get him in the studio he's so gone off that coke, right and it's so sad, cause he's dope, right America's next great white hope, right so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right and which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about they said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit ""Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"" and I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out but I had already hit middle America Parents had all got to likin' me now when suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy all of the hatred for me must've died thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays and anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy and Angelina Jolie is just another ho and Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby you know what I say? No You better save some of them kids from Madonna she needs all the publicity she can get you want a Shady? Well, you got it, man I ain't apologizin' for shit.

Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man shit is too easy nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause (I'm a goat) so don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best but y'all know that (I'm a goat) and like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch but before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start and thank you very much to everybody who was and y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know (I'm a goat) (hahahaha) I'm out, y'all it's been real, peace";Eminem - GOAT

My Name Is"" dropped Started thinking my name was fault Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I've went against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?

But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cause my baby knows that her dad's a soldier Nothing can take her from me Told you I can't sing Oh, well, I tried Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything Daddy would be right there? Guess what? Daddy's here And I ain't going nowhere Baby, I love you;Eminem - Hailie's Song
151;http://www.metrolyrics.com/halies-song-lyrics-eminem.html;Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing I wanna fuckin' sing 'Cause I'm happy Yeah, I'm happy I got my baby back Yo, check it out Somedays I sit staring out the window Watchin' this world pass me by Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for I almost break down and cry Sometimes I think I'm crazy I'm crazy, oh, so crazy Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time? But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't (want her) Now you probably get this picture from my public persona That I'm a pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest 'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world And I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin', three felonies, six years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in?

And mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far? Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I don't hate you cause ma! You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb Equivalent to Chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But, agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both We're in the same fucking boat You'd think that it'd make us close (nope) Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine A car full of belongings Still got a ways to go Back to grandma's house it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest So my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them And although one has only met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one night As we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to lay it fore I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama... I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life, (start over) one without a cause (clean slate) So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up Well, just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die Oh, even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my little girls, so I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life;Eminem - Headlights

Now you sound ridiculous. You dickless piece of shit, how could you diss me bitch? (huh?) I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude. Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you, Started rhymin' then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nuthin. Like you mad that someone else was white and tryin' ta rhyme or somethin'. I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin ta steal your light or nuthin. But you're a homosexual, white rappin' Irish (unknown) Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a (unknown) too. Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do. What's up witchu? I never fucked witchu, why would you fuck with me? Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what? Is you nuts as me? Plus I can sing better than you, and I don't fuckin' sing. And probably play guitar better, and I aint never touched a string. But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you. I'm what you used to be; shit, you was me in '92. So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you. And maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues. (la-di-da) Cuz I remember all those years. How it was when you were here. (I know) I remember how it was. (how it was) How it was when you were young. (when you were young) Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. Cuz I remember all those years. (what) How it was when you were here. (come on) I remember how it was. (how it was) How it was when you were young. Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. Fuckin homo (pussy) Fuckin faggot sissy (fuck) And by the way, 380's a fuckin' sissy gun. (homo) You gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun. (dont fuck wit me) Little bitch. Next time say my fuckin' name in the song. Dont be subliminal about it. (you know) You gonna diss me, fuckin' diss me, fuckin' faggot. Fuckin' punk pussy. Fuckin' little bitch. Fuckin' cunt. Little fuckin'...fuck.";Eminem - I Remember

192;http://www.metrolyrics.com/kick-off-lyrics-eminem.html;"I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fucking obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits I need you to spit that lyrical miracle... in the swimming pool Before this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees 'Cause I'm dottin' i's every time I cross one of these There's not a redeeming quality at all in me It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream Positive clean thoughts intervene But they're all either altered and mean Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme Squashed in-between a brainwashing machine Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical Suicide bomber that's seeing Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region I'm not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons But bring your dogs, I'ma muzzle 'em I'm not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch Raqqa hijab And at least a extra large in the T-shirt Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista I go Hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich Professional shit sprayer Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce Prey's decreasing, I face extinction like disc players Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett And just stared 'til I made her think it Said, ""Maybe we should just get married."" She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square Tell her, ""Turn around,"" spread her legs for me, then I hit bare Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair As I ripped her, anal beads in a split rear Spray Febreze in the chick's hair Make her wheeze tryna get air I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared And chained to me, and throw away the key And she'll be so afraid to leave That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up It's impossible like rapin' a slut We stay butt-naked and fuck You're close, wait for you, what? My idea, you comin' too, it's waking you up With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup Hate to get bogged down in details But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular Shape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck Or helps you rake in the duckets, I want payment in pub 'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no i's in it Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it Tryna commit suicide in it, took five minutes And I survived this shit Someone's gonna challenge me, who? Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale Only time I start a movement's a bowel I can't even give a ""yeah"" or a ""woo"" when you rap in the booth Not even a ""nah"" or a ""boo"" 'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too 'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you Creature from the Black Lagoon I reach up and I smack the moon You're grief struck that I'm back so soon Your teacher for this afternoon Creep up with a pack of hoodlums We pack a punch like Capri Sun Heat tucked like we each snuck in a submachine gun We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms Cup of lean up in the padded room Justin Bieber in a Catholic school Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him Don't adjust your speaker I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop 'Cause her double g-cups are massive, huge!

But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp From the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past 'Cause your heiny's sore, that's 'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass From the night before last No good, but rap somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat Where your cojones at?

So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sowed 'em back Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back So difficult to wrap in the pro-filactic, it overlaps it So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class The bear you don't wanna poke its back The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks When I appear, my peers stop Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock Fear at the mere thought Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top I'm in the sky when I talk Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you I got a idea for a line";Eminem - Kick Off

Have nothin', get it all but too much of it Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens Cause if not, where the hell did it go? Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven Just choosing to sin Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again Do whatever I gotta do just to win Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head Crown around it, thorns on it Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya? How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count Only time I ever been out and about Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin' I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone? Cause someone told me that (Kings never die) Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer Wouldn't even take shit into consideration Obliterate anyone in the way I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire Tell these new artists that kings never die Did it just say I've been upstaged? Why am I online? It's driving me crazy I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform But as days pass in this shit And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous Comeback as if I went away But detractors just say so much for the Renegade Someone's gonna make me blow my composure Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage They so want a champion to fall It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all? So fuck what these cynics say (It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office On the floor stacked against the door Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again? Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards And trophies just don't mean jack anymore If I'm here today and gone tomorrow And I'm not gonna be Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die I want it, I'm comin' to get it So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause They say kings never die Just ask Jam Master Jay They just grow wings and they fly So, hands up, reach for the sky Try to hold and prolong these moments Cause in a blink of an eye They'll be over Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were So before you're leavin' this Earth You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk Deacon of words, syllable genius at work Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness I went from powdered milk and Farina To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is It's that ""Sound Bombing"" Thirstin' Howl Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die";Eminem - Kings Never Die

Who sing this?"" ""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it"" ""It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"" It was predicted by a medic I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue I think I'm dying God is that you? Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP Take me to ER ASAP for an IV Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no Hip-Hop They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is Tupac It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks Just to make a dollar off of black music with a subliminal ball of tricks But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks I'm low down and I'm shifty!

Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64 When they sell out in stores the price triples I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles And colliding with an 80-year old lady with groceries There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties Stood up and started to see stars Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck But I think somebody seen me maybe Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits Came out with a white flag hollerin' ""Truce Truce!""

Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffing ether, Either that or the mother fuckers been puffing reefer, But all this huffing and puffing wasn't what it was either, It was neither I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought, Pee in a tea cup? Bitch you aint my keeper, i'm sleeping, What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for? Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone I aint playing, Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra.

I just want you to be normal Why can't you bitches be normal? Always gotta be so extra Why you always need a lecture? My ex hates to talk, she's a texter Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her Wants to get back together Said not till she gets her act together She thinks I'm bein' mean And now she starts to scream and shout She's about to let the demons out She don't want to see me with other females out I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house in her evening gown with her cleavage out We've been down this road too many times for me to count And all I can think is how I just want you to be normal Why can't you bitches be normal? Always gotta be so extra Like a fuckin' terrestrial Guess it comes with the territory My ex girl, she just declared war Therefore, I better prepare for it I guess bein' weird's normal And I don't know what's got a hold of me Most notably I've been zoning to Jodeci I'm totally open, hoplessly devoted So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of before I go to sleep Sike Hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse I know she cheats Told her she's heartless She's heartless No wonder we're partners Both got hundreds of charges Domestic disputes but we've always Swept it under the carpet Even when 911 gets the call that I slipped up and busted her jaw with A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it Really does is make our love For each other grow stronger She won me over the second she tried to run me over Told her I'd keep a hun We all but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over But why is she so wicked? And how the fuck did I get so twisted I picked someone that's so unlock-able and shifty We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with Ignitable liquids But I'm finally seeing She's only mine for the time being That's why I keep bringing up that one time she Tried to two time me And throw it up in her face till I dry heave How could I be so naive? Should I leave or turn this entire evening to a motherfucking crime scene Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him You weren't supposed to agree you fucking bitch Especially when you're the one cheated first Now the argument immediately becomes heated You don't want me flip little conceded cunt Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita Fajita slut treat just like a drum Beat it, complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it! I love you but I hope you fucking die though In our business your friends like to pry so You've got 'em all under cover just like moles Hoppin' they'll come back with intel But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral 'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone Who the fuck's Milo? The guy at work who drives a hi-lo I put a tracking device on your Chrysler And follow you while you drive home But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown You recognize me and had Milo flip me off right out the passenger side window I hit a light pole, you skirt off and then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo But like a drunk bum what do I know?

There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go Into waters where nobody else has gone before Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am... I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Let me self-empower you When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel Convert it to gunpowder too Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage Never take back what you say If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match Ready to scrap asap Take your fists and just ball it Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at And set it on 'em like a placemat (I am phenomenal) And I want you to say that I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Step into the unknown and find yourself You're floating freely, no emotion Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground Cause I worked my butt off now It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about Cause I stuck it out Like a motherfucking tongue thats how, I responded when I got shoved around You're gonna have non-believers But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how Get it how you live But are you prepared to give more than you get? And put in twice what you get back from this shit Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give Rap is my shiv But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt Ready to face any challenge, waitin' Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation Look what I have built, reputation is validation The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact That is the only way you'll ever be able to say Your legend is makin' an allegation I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath Managed to prove who the best man is Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal;Eminem - Phenomenal

Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standing on corners and porches just rapping To having a fortune, no more kissing ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids been listening to me religiously So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B It's all political, if my music is literal Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?

Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die 'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

You know the song by Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" About that guy, who coulda saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't then Phil saw it all then at that show he found him That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drownin' No it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted, was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures of the wall I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me See Slim; shut up bitch!

I say that shit just clowning dog c'mon - how fucked up is you? You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about, his name was. it was you Damn!";Eminem - Stan

334;http://www.metrolyrics.com/stepping-stone-lyrics-eminem.html;Its 2002, everything was totally new We were globally huge Watching sales go through the roof We wrote and we viewed it Runyon Avenue soldiers included A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse We were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth Thought we was running shit till we lost the sole of our shoe The death of Doody broke us in two We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do And at the time I was going through my own struggles too So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew I was hoping they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth 'Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died So did the group If I could leave this world behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may May end up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones It was never the same, and it's bothered me since And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets The more time goes by, the more life happens And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends Which reminded me Biz Rockstar was the shit Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did More than try talking you into coming up off of it I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers I wish that we would've politicked with Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features But that's water under the bridge But I'm washing my sins in it till my conscious is clear If I could leave this world behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may May end up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones Bacardi in hand Never thought the party would end One minute you're bodying shit but then your audience splits You can already sense the climate is starting to shift To these kids you no longer exist Went from raining cats and dogs in this bitch To tiny drops full of drips And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed You start thinking of all the artists you gift All the carnage you left Is this the kinda karma you get? For turning your fucking back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift A Freudian slip Subconsciously, I honestly wished I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this Wish I had words But I guess they're just owning for this Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you, men But I just can't be the guy Everybody depends on for entire careers 'Cause that's not even fair I will always be here But that spark isn't there And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air I've tried hearkening back to But I'm fighting for air I'm barely charting myself Feels like I'm under the sink But it was not my intent To treat y'all like a stepping stone Though I ain't left no one behind But we been down every road Done all we possibly can I know we kept up our hopes up But the longer we spend living this lie that we live The less is left for closure, so let's let this go It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may End up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones;Eminem - Stepping Stone

Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer Cause this morning I finally stood up Held my chin up, finally showed a sign Of life in me for the, first time since you left me And left me with nothing but shattered dreams And the life we coulda, had and we could've been But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in Pulling myself out of the dumps once again I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit I'ma be late for the pity party But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again Took it on the chin like a champ So don't lump me in with the chump-ions I'm done being your punching bag It was the November 31st today Would've been our anniversary Two years but you left on the 1st of May I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call But couldn't think of the words to say But they came to me just now So I put 'em in a verse to lay And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh But I'mma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you"" Cause I'm stronger than I was";Eminem - Stronger Than I Was

It feels so wrong cause it feels so right, But its all right, its ok with me, I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me, But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance, But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm Taking My Ball and going home, hooome Shady what are you doing chewing on a human, Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM! Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room Using the bathroom vacuum and a racoon, Skewing a rat a cat screwing a baboon, You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom, You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds, You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance ooh, But their afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for, Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk? Cause I'm scared there's monster's under my bed, Kelly Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet, No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed, You like graffiti dike, well I can pee pee and write your name, It feels so wrong cause it feels so right, But its all right, its ok with me, I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me, But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance, But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm Taking My Ball and going home, hooome Fine nobody wants to play with me Fuck you then bitch!

Should I of spoon fed 'em it? but I was just so eager to prove I was even worth being in the same league or the room with of the people of whom I was in every now and then I look up like I was seeking approval was it because of the pigment of my skin or was it a figment of my imagination maybe it bothered me more than it did them maybe it wasn't a big deal back then but to me it was, see what it was was I had developed the complex from being judged Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who I'm in the booth staring back to see who's mugs I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb was from Proof and the rest of the group backed him up and no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals it was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal Sometimes I feel like it's just me sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree I said ... sometimes I feel like it's just me sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree Ever since my mother was pregnant with her second egg cause she said that I had a baby sister who fell out of the window I was too young to remember Kansas City projects I was like 5, 6, and how come I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie if it was the projects in Missouri? cause those're my best friends until Isaac took my tricycle and my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back and ended up getting jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and 70-some stitches which is still, to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture of a fictitious little sister who never existed and this is why part of my life's so twisted but I can never be as sick as that bitch is and, by the way, that picture's one of my relatives Sometimes I feel like it's just me sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree I said ... sometimes I feel like it's just me sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain to see why everything I say is so insane what's different about my brain that separates me from other players in this game? on the surface, it may seem like a scheme or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy but that's the last thing I need is for people to walk around feeling sorry for me (me) and I'm not a G, never claimed to be I gave my vest to Cashis, he'll need it more than me but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef but if it comes our way, what do we, turn the other cheek? come on Sometimes I feel like it's just me sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree I said ... sometimes I feel like it's just me sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree;Eminem - The Apple

Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny So they're laughing at basically nothing Except maybe wasting their money Meanwhile Zach's in a coma The action is over, and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga And that's the story of Zach: The Ecstasy maniac So, don't even feed that to squirrels, class, cause it's bad for you See children, drugs are bad (that's right) And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right) And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can) She'll tell you how she does them all the time (she will) So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack) So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right) And there's really nothing else to say (uh huh) Drugs are just bad, m'kay?

Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair Mr. Shady, what's a g-string? It's yarn Clair, women stick them up their behinds go out and wear them And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus Your tounge gets All swolled up, like a cow's tongue (How come?)

Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be The most meanest MC on this on this Earth And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress That's been eating me recently off of this chest And I rest again peacefully But at least have the decency in you To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter To not come and speak to me I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me My tank is on empty, no patience is in me And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean But that's all I can be, it's just me And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant And, Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses And all of this controversy circles me And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin Where were the parents at? And look where it's at! Middle America, now it's a tragedy Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city Havin' this happening Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way But I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is"" And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations And I just do not got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls So they always keep asking the same fucking questions What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how Till I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out 'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit And I'm thankful for every fan that I get But I can't take a shit in the bathroom Without someone standing by it No, I won't sign you an autograph You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause... And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I musta struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' it I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America, I could be one of your kids White America, little Eric looks just like this White America, Erica loves my shit I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get White America, I could be one of your kids White America, little Eric looks just like this White America, Erica loves my shit I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself If they were brown Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby!)

All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin' Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit Just look at me like I'm your closest pal The posterchild, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for White America, I could be one of your kids White America, little Eric looks just like this White America, Erica loves my shit I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get White America, I could be one of your kids White America, little Eric looks just like this White America, Erica loves my shit I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica to attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress And piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy Fuck you Ms. Cheney, Fuck you Tipper Gore Fuck you with the free-est of speech This Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have Fuck you!
